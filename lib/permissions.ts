/**
 * Client-side mirror of the server's permission vocabulary.
 *
 * The server owns authorization — config/permissions.js is the single source of
 * truth, and every guarded route enforces it. This file exists only so the UI
 * can decide what to *show*, using the same words the server uses to decide
 * what to *allow*. Hiding a button the server would reject is a courtesy;
 * showing one it would reject is a bug, and gating on the server's own array
 * is what keeps the two from drifting.
 *
 * The rule this replaces: `user.role === "ADMIN"`. That was accurate while
 * ADMIN and AGENT were the only roles, and became wrong the moment MARKETING
 * arrived — a marketer who can author campaigns server-side would still have
 * seen "Admin access only" on every screen that asked about the role instead of
 * the capability.
